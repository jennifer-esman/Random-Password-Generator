## General Info
The project was initialized to create a random password generator that allows for a range of characters and gives the user a randomly generated password.
* This application will generate a random password on the click of the "generate password" button.
* A series of prompts and confirm boxes pop up for the user to customize their password content.
* The password is required to have at least 8 characters and less than 128 characters, and if the criteria selected is no good, at the end of the confirmation process, there will be an alert that no password can be generated.
* The password is displayed on the page and may be selected for copy and paste.
* The page resizes to the appropriate view on various screens and devices.
* The page has a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.
